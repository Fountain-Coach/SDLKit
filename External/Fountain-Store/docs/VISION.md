# FountainStore: The Memory Core for FountainAI

## What We’re Building (Plain Language)
FountainStore is like a **digital filing cabinet** designed especially for FountainAI.
It stores all of our important information objects (notes, tasks, conversations) safely,
and makes them easy to find again later.

---

## Why It Matters
- **Safe**: Nothing gets lost, even if the system crashes mid‑save.
- **Fast**: Finds what you need instantly, even among millions of entries.
- **Private**: Runs locally inside FountainAI, with no outside servers involved.
- **Evolves**: Can adapt to new data shapes as FountainAI grows.

---

## Everyday Metaphors
- **Notebook**: Every change is first jotted down quickly (our write‑ahead log).
- **Whiteboard**: Recent items stay handy for quick access (our in‑memory store).
- **Binders**: Older notes are neatly archived in order (our on‑disk tables).
- **Librarian**: Keeps binders tidy, merging them for faster lookups (compaction).

## What People Can Do With It
- Save new records instantly and safely.
- Retrieve records by ID, tag, or keyword.
- Look back at how records looked in the past.
- Trust that data stays consistent and private.

## The Ambition
We’re not just building another database. We’re giving FountainAI its own **memory core** —
Swift‑native, reliable, and tuned to support everything from coaching interactions to planning
and narrative building.

# Test Plan

## Core
- Put/Get/Delete round trips
- MVCC history retrieval
- Range/prefix scans
- WAL append and replay on startup
- SSTable read path after memtable flush and restart
- Crash recovery matrix (kill at WAL append, after append before fsync, after fsync before memtable apply, etc.)
- Randomized crash-recovery property tests
- Manifest integrity

## Transactions
- Multi‑collection atomicity
- Unique index enforcement
- Index scans (prefix)
- Snapshot repeatability

## Observability
- Operation metrics counters and history logging

## Optional Modules
- FTS search with BM25 ranking and custom analyzers
- Vector search via HNSW using L2 and cosine metrics
- FTS and vector index persistence across restart

## Infrastructure
- Linting via SwiftFormat and SwiftLint in CI
- Build step (`swift build -c release`) and tests with coverage (`swift test --enable-code-coverage`) run in CI
- Release workflow builds the package and uploads compiled artifacts for tagged versions

## Performance
- Put/Get throughput benchmarks via `FountainStoreBenchmarks`
- Benchmark workflow uploads JSON metrics from CI runs
- Write amplification tracking
- Bloom false‑positive sampling

# Legacy Documents

This directory collects SDLKit planning material that predates the current 3D graphics and GPU compute roadmap defined in `AGENTS.md`.

- `Fountain Coach SDLKit – Current Implementation Status (Pre-Alpha).pdf` — Archived status snapshot from the earliest pre-alpha window/GUI agent work.
- `SDLKit Feature Completeness Analysis.pdf` — Previous feature gap review superseded by the milestone plan (M0–M6) captured in `AGENTS.md`.
- `SDLKit – Swift SDL3 Wrapper Architecture and Design.pdf` and `SDLKit.pdf.txt` — Original SDL3 wrapper architecture now replaced by the multi-agent extension design and contracts outlined in `AGENTS.md` and the follow-up agent specifications.

These documents remain available for historical reference but are no longer authoritative for the project’s active milestones.
